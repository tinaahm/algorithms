Task A:
For the regex for "pg4200_00000.zip" I have taken the assumption that there
should be 5 numbers before the ".zip" despite there being 4 numbers in the
"kandidatnummer" that is meant to be the "id" part of the filename of this
particular exam. This expression will result in a match if the name begins
precisely with "pg4200_" and ends with ".zip" with 5 numbers in between which
can be between 0 and 9.
The regex is as follows:
"pg4200_[0-9]{5}\.zip"

Task B:
The regex for this task is constructed to match an entire sentence consisting of
any characters besides punctuation marks, any number of times, ([^.!?]*?) until
it runs into a punctuation mark ([.?!]); given that there is one or more
occurrences of "algorithms", "algdat" or "pg4200" in the sentence ((algorithms|algdat|pg4200)).

The complete expression is as follows:
"[^.!?]*?(algorithms|algdat|pg4200)[.?!]"
